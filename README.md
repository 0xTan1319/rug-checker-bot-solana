# Solana Rug Checker  

`Solana Rug Checker` is a TypeScript-based tool designed to monitor new token creation events within the **Raydium** decentralized exchange ecosystem on the **Solana blockchain**. 

The tool listens to blockchain logs to detect new token signatures associated with Raydium's liquidity pools, stores relevant data (e.g., creator information and token balances), and performs automated risk analysis to help identify potentially fraudulent tokens.
